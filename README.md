# FBI Crime Investigation Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting crime patterns using advanced machine learning and time series analysis techniques. The system processes historical crime data, extracts meaningful features, and builds predictive models to forecast future crime trends and patterns.

## Features

### Data Processing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering and selection
- Time series decomposition

### Analysis & Visualization
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Temporal pattern identification
- Seasonal trend analysis
- Interactive visualizations

### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Time series forecasting models
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Advanced Features
- Imbalanced data handling
- Feature importance analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model interpretability
